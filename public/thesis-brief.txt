Master's Thesis – Executive Brief

Title
Evaluating the ARIMA-GARCH Model's Accuracy Across Diverse Cryptocurrencies
(BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL)

Scope
- Daily data from 2020-05-11 to 2024-04-20
- Consistent ARIMA + GARCH-family framework across 4 assets
- Out-of-sample forecasts for horizons 1/3/7/14/30 and rolling backtests

Method
- Train/validation/test split (70/15/15)
- Auto-tuning via AIC + parameter significance
- Benchmarks: naive returns and EWMA volatility
- Tests: Diebold-Mariano, Kupiec, Christoffersen

Key findings
- No consistent one-step return edge versus naive benchmark
- Significant medium-horizon signals for selected assets (notably SOL)
- Strong practical utility for volatility and 5% VaR risk estimation
